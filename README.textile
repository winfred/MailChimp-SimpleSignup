MailChimp Simple Signup
Version: ~0.0.1


h1. Features:

* facebook information subscription of MailChimp list
* grabs email, fname, and lname - for now
* standard facebook button theme

h1. Ideas:
* other fields to be grabbed from fbook, location(zip)?,website? derp?
* Other OAuth providers?

h1. TODO:
* Important: dynamic merge values and corresponding button changes
* Merge value report on the dashboard to alert user of list-form incompatibility with facebook 
** ie. they require a value within the MailChimp form that is not submitted here
* Full button-side error reporting
* scrolling button text? UX ideas
* style admin/dashboard pages
* dashboard button customization code (button-width slider, custom text)


h1. Bullshit:
* Facebook requires "localhost" dev application URLs
* MailChimp requires "127.0.0.1" dev application URLs
* I'm not sure if a simplesignup.dev workaround will work given a likely "invalid domain" error on the app-registration side
* other ideas?

h1. Dev environment setup:
# create couchDBs somewhere (iriscouch.com) and hookup to config/database.js
# register MailChimp dev/pro Oauth applications and hookup to config/oauth.js
# plug in API keys for each MC account for async testing in test/models/factory/user.js
# $ npm install
# expresso test/models/*
# expresso test/controllers/*

h4. Some notes about that shit for right now:
* follow corresponding *Example.js for 1-3 above
* user_id and list_id in test/models/subscription have not been moved to factory yet 
** I plan on moving them when I implement dynamic merge values
* the same goes for statically coded ids in test/controllers/subscription_controller
